# Heart Attack Prediction & Analysis

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on patient data. It includes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and training of four ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Methodologies

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling imbalance using SMOTE
- Model training and evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
- Hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost and Random Forest

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## How to Run

Follow these steps to get the notebook up and running on your machine and ensure you have python and jupyter notebook installed. Python version 3.12.8 was used for this project.
